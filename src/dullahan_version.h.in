// The build version number as of v1.2 is now the date/time the build was made
// It is only regenerated if the constructed version header (dullahan_version.h)
// is not present when the Cmake script is executed. Not perfect - one can still
// have different build numbers for same set of source files - but it thankfully
// removed the requirement to remember to change the version/build number each
// time a change is made to the Dullahan source (which was often missed).
